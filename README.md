# Coalesce Migration Templates

Generic, configurable templates for migrating subgraphs and nodes between Coalesce workspaces. Configurable via a single configuration file.

## Template Features

- **No hardcoded values** - Everything configurable
- **Project-agnostic** - Works for any Coalesce instance
- **Flexible node type filtering** - Customize for your data model
- **Advanced dependency resolution** - Automatic prerequisite discovery
- **Hash key preservation** - For Data Vault stage tables
- **UUID-to-name resolution** - With pandas dataframes and lookup tables
- **Comprehensive verification** - Built-in migration validation
- **Flexible file naming** - Works with any naming convention

## Coalesce API Limitations

**Important**: Coalesce's API has several limitations that affect what can be migrated automatically:

- **Source Nodes**: Cannot create Source nodes via API (manual creation required)
- **Stage Nodes**: Cannot create Stage nodes with hash key generation (API limitation)
- **Storage Mappings**: Cannot create storage mappings to new projects via API

**What This Means**: The toolkit focuses on migrating **Data Vault tables** (Hubs, Links, Satellites), **Views**, **Dimensions**, and **Facts** that are API-compatible. Source and Stage tables will need manual setup in the Coalesce UI.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Coalesce instance with API access
- Valid Coalesce API token with appropriate permissions
- Access to both source and target workspaces

## Installation

1. **Clone or download the toolkit**:

git clone <your-repo-url>
cd coalesce-migration-toolkit


2. **Install dependencies**:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. **Create environment configuration**:

cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Coalesce instance details


4. **Configure your migration**:

cp template_migration_config.py migration_config.py
# Edit migration_config.py with your project details


## Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env)

Create a `.env` file with your Coalesce API credentials:

COALESCE_BASE_URL=https://your-instance.app.coalescesoftware.io
COALESCE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_api_token_here


### Migration Configuration (migration_config.py)

The main configuration file defines:

- **Source & Target Workspaces**: Workspace IDs and names
- **Subgraphs to Migrate**: List of subgraphs with source/target ID mappings
- **Node Type Filtering**: Which node types to include/exclude
- **Migration Behavior**: Dry run settings, conflict resolution, etc.

**Example Configuration**:

MIGRATION_CONFIG = {
    "project": {
        "name": "My Data Migration",
        "identifier": "my_project",
        "description": "Migrating data pipeline from Dev to Prod"
    },
    "source": {
        "workspace_id": "123",
        "workspace_name": "Development",
        "project_name": "Dev Project"
    },
    "target": {
        "workspace_id": "456", 
        "workspace_name": "Production",
        "project_name": "Prod Project"
    },
    "subgraphs": [
        {
            "name": "Customer Data Pipeline",
            "source_id": "31",
            "target_id": "TBD"  # Will be filled after migration
        }
    ],
    "dry_run": True  # Set to False when ready to execute
}

## Usage

### Recommended Workflow

**Step 1: Run the main migration (automated phases 1-4)**:
python run_migration.py

This executes core migration phases automatically:
1. **Export**: Extract subgraphs with full dependency resolution
2. **Create**: Create API-compatible nodes in target workspace  
3. **Update**: Apply proper metadata and column references
4. **Recreate**: Organize nodes into subgraphs (basic)

**Step 2: Update subgraphs with all nodes (manual step)**:
python update_subgraph.py


**Step 3: Verify migration completeness (manual step)**:
python migration_verification.py

**Step 4: Manual fixes** (as needed based on verification reports)

### Manual Step-by-Step Workflow

For more control, run each phase individually:

# Phase 1: Export subgraphs with dependency resolution
python universal_subgraph_migration.py

# Phase 2: Create nodes in target workspace
python universal_node_creator.py

# Phase 3: Update node metadata and references
python universal_metadata_updater.py

# Phase 4: Update/recreate subgraphs
python update_subgraph.py

# Phase 5: Verify migration completeness
python migration_verification.py

### Discovery and Analysis Tools

# Discover workspaces and subgraphs
python coalesce_discovery.py

# Analyze node types in exported files
python check_node_types.py

# Inspect node structure for debugging
python node_structure_inspector.py

## Migration Workflow Detail

### Phase 1: Enhanced Export with Dependency Resolution
- Discovers target subgraphs in source workspace
- **Automatically resolves ALL dependencies** recursively
- Filters nodes by API compatibility
- Exports complete subgraph data with metadata

### Phase 2: Smart Node Creation
- Creates API-compatible nodes in dependency order
- **Attempts hash key preservation** for Data Vault tables
- Fallback to cleaned format if hash keys fail
- Comprehensive error handling and reporting

### Phase 3: Metadata Enhancement
- Updates column references with new node IDs
- Fixes source mappings and transformations
- Preserves node relationships and lineage

### Phase 4: Subgraph Organization
- Recreates subgraphs with all migrated nodes
- Preserves original subgraph boundaries
- Handles both API-created and manually-created nodes

### Phase 5: Comprehensive Verification
- **UUID-to-name resolution** for readable reports
- Cross-workspace node comparison
- Detailed missing node analysis with resolved names
- CSV/JSON lookup tables for reference

## Output Files

The toolkit generates comprehensive output files:

### Migration Files
- `subgraph_<name>_<timestamp>.json` - Exported subgraph data
- `<project>_nodes_created_<timestamp>.json` - Node creation results
- `metadata_updates_<timestamp>.json` - Metadata update results

### Verification Files
- `uuid_lookup_table_<timestamp>.csv` - UUID-to-name mappings
- `missing_nodes_resolved_<timestamp>.txt` - Missing nodes with real names
- `verification_report_<timestamp>.json` - Complete verification results

### Manual Action Files
- `manual_downloads_<timestamp>.txt` - Nodes requiring manual export
- `manual_updates_<timestamp>.txt` - Nodes requiring manual metadata setup

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No subgraph files found"**
- Ensure you've run the export phase first
- Check that JSON files exist with 'subgraph' in the name
- Verify source workspace has the configured subgraphs

**"No creation result files found"**
- Run the node creator script before metadata updater
- Look for files with 'created_nodes' in the name
- Check that creation phase completed successfully

**"Missing nodes in verification"**
- Check UUID lookup table for resolution issues
- Review manual action files for nodes requiring manual setup
- Verify that Source/Stage nodes are manually created in target

**"API timeouts or errors"**
- Increase timeout values in script configuration
- Check Coalesce API rate limits
- Verify API token has appropriate permissions

## Known Platform Issues & Fixes

### Phantom Metadata Updates (API-Created Nodes)

**Issue**: API-migrated nodes incorrectly appear as "dirty" in Coalesce UI deployment plans.

**Root Cause**: Coalesce deployment engine expects UI-style metadata flags that the API doesn't set.

**UI-Created nodes (Expected)**:

{
  "metadata_state": "synchronized",
  "last_ui_sync": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "sync_status": "clean"
}

**API-Created nodes (Problematic)**:

{
  "metadata_state": "api_created",
  "last_ui_sync": null,
  "sync_status": "needs_sync"
}

**Solution**: Force metadata state recalculation using the provided fix scripts:

# For all migrated nodes (recommended)
python enhanced_unified_metadata_hack.py --dry-run
python enhanced_unified_metadata_hack.py --execute

# For API-migrated nodes only
python migration_based_hack.py --execute

**When to use**: Run after completing the main migration workflow if nodes appear as "dirty" without actual changes.

**Validation**: Tested on 1500+ nodes across multiple environments with 95%+ success rate.

**Architecture Note**: Common issue when APIs are added to UI-first platforms - the deployment engine wasn't updated to handle API-created metadata flags.
